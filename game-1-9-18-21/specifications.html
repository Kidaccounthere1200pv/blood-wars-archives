A card cannot perform its abilities while inside the cocoon. Already placed/existing abilities will still work.
                        Cocoon breaks on the first attack or lynch attempt. Cocoon can also be broken manually, but manually breaking it takes one phase during which a card cannot be protected.

                        At night, Engineer starts with 200 metal and gains 30 metal every night. At night, it can build one of these structures:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sentry costs 130 metal. Sentry is placed on one of your cards; cards attacking it will be killed by Sentry and their protection will be bypassed (but it won't protect the card from attacks). After 2 attacks it dies. Engineer can use 150 metal ONCE to repair it and activate it same night (but not change the target on which it is placed).</li>
                            <li>Dispenser costs 100 metal. Dispenser is placed between 2 neighbour cards, heals both of them so they won't die at night, dies after protecting from 2 attacks and cannot be repaired.</li>
                            <li>Teleporter costs 100 metal. Engineer can place an entrance and an exit on one of his attackers and on an opponent's card. Attacking that card afterwards will ignore protection, Teleporter doesn't count as a protection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Everything, after placed, will turn on the next night. Moving one of these structures at night costs 50 metal, and Engineer cannot build new structures while moving one of them.

                        Every night, the current owner of this card can send it to attach itself to another player's card, roleblocking it while its attached. That player will then own the card and can use it to vote during the day. If the card the Guest is currently attached to dies, Guest will also die. When the Guest leaves the original deck containing it, it will show it as (missing) and therefore cant be targeted. When this card dies, it will return to the original deck labeled dead.
